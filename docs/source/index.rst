Tinker Engine
=============

Welcome! Tinker Engine is a Python framework for running computational
experiments that probe how various algorithms perform under different
experimental protocols. Tinker Engine gives you the power to design the
protocols, gather existing and new algorithms, and manage your experimental
configurations and input/output data all under a single framework.

See the :ref:`overview` for a more detailed discussion of what Tinker Engine is,
how it works, and what it can do for you. See the :ref:`getting_started` guide
to jump in and start running your own experiments.
